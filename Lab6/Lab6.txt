#. What are the advantages and disadvantages of manual testing?
	Advantages: Ensures that the system is indeed human friendly, is also far better suited for testing of images or gradients (namely bitmaps). Also, can help catch some bugs that automated testing could miss.
Disadvantages: Takes a lot of time to test everything by hand and can get monotonous. 

#. What are the advantages and disadvantages of automated testing?
	Advantages: Takes far less time to run automated tests than doing the same tests by hand. Can catch certain bugs that manual testing might overlook (since a tester might forget to click a certain button)
Disadvantages: Can sometimes miss bugs that could be caught by manual testing, also requires a good amount of code to be written in order to do said test.

#. What new bugs did you encounter with the new code?
	None
#. How many UI tests did you generate? How did you deteremine you had written enough?
	8. I determined I had enough when I had covered all the requirements. 
#. How long did this lab take to accomplish?
