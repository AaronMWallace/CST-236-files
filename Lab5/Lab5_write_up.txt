Lab#5 write-up

1.	As per the usual, (for me at least) the most difficult part of this lab was that it was in python. Since I have never been taught python, I’ve had to teach it to myself as I try to complete the assignments and balance my 3 other classes.

2.	Performance testing is when a test is done to determine if something performs to some minimum requirement. Performance measuring is when the performance test results are stored and then graphed over time.

3.	Any call to “get_other_users” would cause the test to take an additional 20 seconds for unknown reasons.

4.	I kept the same mock function for “get_other_users” as I had from Lab#4, which was evidently incorrect.

5.	Sorry, didn’t get around to this one. 

6.	Types of performance tests

	a.	Load testing checks the systems reaction when it is under a heavy load, can also be used to see what happens if a max value is reached or exceeded. 
	b.	Stress testing is essentially the same as load testing, just with a fancy new name! 
	c.	Endurance testing checks for how well a system performs after running for an extended period of time.
	d.	Spike testing checks what happens to a system when the word load suddenly spikes.
	e.	Configuration testing checks to see how a system would perform if a part of the configuration was changed (such as run on a different OS, a slower system, Intel vs. AMD, etc…
	f.	Isolation testing checks if each individual software component meets its own minimum performance requirements.
	
7.	At least 20 hour and still not 100% done…
